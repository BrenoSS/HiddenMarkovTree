# HiddenMarkovTree
Python implementation of the Hidden Markov Tree to model probabilistic dependency of the Wavelet Transform coefficients through scales of decomposition.

The code was developed during my Master's, and is primarly based on the following works:

* Wavelet-Based Statistical Signal Processing Using Hidden Markov Models, 1998,  IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, by M.S. Crouse, R.D. Nowak, and R.G. Baraniuk.
* Computational methods for hidden Markov tree models- An application to wavelet trees, 2004, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing by  Jean-Baptiste Durand, Paulo Goncalvès, Yann Guédon.
